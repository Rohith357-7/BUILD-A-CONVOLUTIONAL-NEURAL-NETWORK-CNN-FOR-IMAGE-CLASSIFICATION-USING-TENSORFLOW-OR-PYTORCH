# BUILD-A-CONVOLUTIONAL-NEURAL-NETWORK-CNN-FOR-IMAGE-CLASSIFICATION-USING-TENSORFLOW-OR-PYTORCH
In this project, a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) was built and trained using the CIFAR-10 dataset for image classification. The model utilizes TensorFlow, one of the most popular deep learning frameworks, to process and classify images based on their features.
